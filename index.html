        <p><strong>Dear travelers,</strong></p>

        <p>
          Back on <strong>June 2, 2025</strong>, we shared our initial shutdown notice. After almost 10 years helping plan and document your
          adventures around the world, Luthier Labs made the difficult decision to shut down the Tripify app (web, iOS, and Android)
          on <strong>July 3, 2025</strong>. As of today, the platform is no longer available.
        </p>

        <p>
          We know many of you had treasured memories stored on Tripify, and we deeply regret any inconvenience this transition caused.
          The pandemic presented immense challenges to the tourism sector, directly impacting our growth and sustainability. Since then,
          we faced difficulties balancing Tripify with other personal and professional projects. Moreover, the evolution of artificial
          intelligence has changed the way we plan trips, making it possible to create personalized itineraries with just one prompt,
          for example.
        </p>

        <p>
          Despite this news, we have much to celebrate. We had nearly 10 years of learning, challenges, and, above all, an incredible
          community of travelers who trusted us to plan and record their experiences. A special thank you to the Apple team, who always
          believed in Tripify and provided us with unique experiences, such as our participation in the Apple Entrepreneur Camp – an
          opportunity that provided invaluable lessons we’ll carry for life.
        </p>
